As the current President, I am running for Vice-President for the upcoming academic year to continue the initiatives I've started in the past year and to support the society as it evolves and grows. As VP, my goals would be to:
<ul>
<li>
Ease our transition from online to in-person
</li>
<li>
Continue publication of the digital magazine I started in 2021
</li>
<li>
Continue developing and supporting the Development Mentorship program I started in 2022
</li>
<li>
Seek out collaborations with other societies and organizations to expand our Carleton tech community
</li>
<li>
Support the next President in managing board internals and organization
</li>
</ul>
I'm excited to have another chance to make an impact in Carleton CS and keep this society growing!
