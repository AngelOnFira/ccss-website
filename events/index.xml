Given that there were many audience questions left unanswered during his previous lecture, and many of you expressed interest in having Jeremy back, we are very happy to be hosting this follow-up discussion session.</description></item><item><title>Winter Prof Social</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/ccss-website/events/2020-2021/2021-03-26-prof-social/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/ccss-website/events/2020-2021/2021-03-26-prof-social/</guid><description>Description In the spirit of staying connected with one another in a remote learning environment, the CCSS cordially invites you to a virtual Prof Social, to be hosted on Zoom!
During the event, students and faculty members will have a chance to mingle with one another in a number of breakout rooms. At regular intervals, participants will be prompted to switch rooms and continue the conversation with new faces! This event was inspired by the Prof Nights from previous years, and serves as a COVID-safe substitute.</description></item><item><title>Become a Senior Engineer in 2 years</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/ccss-website/events/2020-2021/academic/2021-03-24-become-a-senior-developer/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/ccss-website/events/2020-2021/academic/2021-03-24-become-a-senior-developer/</guid><description>Description Ryan Latta will be talking about what it takes to become a Senior level engineer!
