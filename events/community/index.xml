Since we can&amp;rsquo;t meet in-person, this year&amp;rsquo;s version of Prof Night will be taking place on Zoom!
Students and faculty members will have a chance to mingle with one another in a number of breakout rooms. We have also invited the Fall Carleton CS graduating cohort to join us and commemorate their success!</description></item><item><title>Equity &amp; Inclusion</title><link>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2020-2021/community/2020-11-12-equity-and-inclusion/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ccss.carleton.ca/events/2020-2021/community/2020-11-12-equity-and-inclusion/</guid><description>Description Do you want to learn more about equity, inclusion and how student communities can strive to empower everybody?
